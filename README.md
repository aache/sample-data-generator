📌 Friend Request Dataset + DSA Practice in JavaScript

This project generates a synthetic social-network dataset and uses it to practice Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in JavaScript.
The dataset simulates 20,000+ friend-request events between 2,000 unique users, including detailed user attributes.

This repo is perfect for:
	•	Practicing graph algorithms
	•	Practicing DSA fundamentals using real-world data
	•	Understanding mutual friendships, communities, shortest paths, etc.
	•	Simulating how social networks (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) model relationships

  📂 Project Structure

🔍 Dataset Details
The CSV contains 20,000+ rows.
Generated using @faker-js/faker.

🚀 DSA Practice (Using Real Data)

This dataset allows you to implement real DSA problems such as:

🔹 Easy
	•	Count unique senders / receivers
	•	Top 10 most requested users
	•	Daily / monthly grouping
	•	Acceptance rates

🔹 Medium
	•	Build a directed/undirected graph
	•	Mutual friend detection
	•	Spam detection (sliding window)
	•	Graph degrees (in-degree / out-degree)

🔹 Hard
	•	BFS shortest path between users
	•	Connected components
	•	Detect friend circles (triangles / cliques)
	•	PageRank / centrality metrics
	•	Community detection (Louvain-style logic)

More scripts will be added here as learning progresses.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project exists for hands-on DSA practice using realistic data, instead of artificial LeetCode-style arrays.

It teaches:
	•	Graph theory
	•	Hash maps and sets
	•	BFS / DFS
	•	Pathfinding
	•	Social network algorithms
	•	Data loading & processing pipelines
	•	Working with large datasets in JavaScript

🛠️ Requirements
	•	Node.js 18+
	•	npm installed
	•	CSV file generated by generate-data.js

Install Faker:
npm install @faker-js/faker

📖 Future Plans
	•	Friend recommendation engine
	•	Jaccard similarity
	•	Triangle detection (3-cliques)
	•	Community detection
	•	PageRank
	•	Visualization (D3.js / sigma.js)
	•	Full graph-analytics dashboard
